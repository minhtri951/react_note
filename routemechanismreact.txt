-some note for react, client, front-end define, conceps, mechanism of route, render
-route mechanism of react
+route is sub base url, domain,.. belong to server, backend side: api, url, json resp or html resp

-Before, old time:

frontend web is a design of each page html. And server side respone this for each route. 
Js have ajax call, but not across route. client not able switch route.
But, JS able to redirect to athoner route. its a mechanism of browser, when click a tag, or redirect() with JS
web will swich to another route, with reload page annd request to server to resp content for that route.
So, web have behavors:
+display page in route, actions js, js ajax call, fecht in this toute
+redirect to a anohter route, reload, reqest server for that route
->server serving routes ! client not able to use route withthout not reload page!
->concept of route only in server and implemetn in server!
->browser use reps from server, and ruun for this route! client dont care about route!
->redirect is mechianism of browser, action by browser, to request to server to abother router!
-> JS can not do this directly !

-Come from react!: (React Router, Navlink, Link)
react is a server, have routes, and serving routes, eachpage in a route
But, further more, the page resp from react server able to switch to another route, offline, not reload, request 
resp from server!
-> Thinking is this page serving from server have JS code, that can actions DOM route, and use content loaded 
from this page prev. Switch offline to other route, can be use conntent loaded, or fecht from anoher server API, 
to riches content.
Using Link to, Navlink to do this!
-> Difine Router in react server use for 2 slide, both client and server. 
+Server use to serving soure page for eachroute !
+Client single page reponsed from this server have soure, have enough conntent-soure, can be swithc to other route offline!
-Define of routes:
Router
  Route A
  Route B
  Route C
Router
Use for both client and server !
